**Linux Cluster Monitor** [[GitHub](https://github.com/jarviscanada/jarvis_data_eng_HassanAkbar/tree/masterhttps://github.com/jarviscanada/jarvis_data_eng_HassanAkbar/tree/master/linux_sql)]: Implemented a Cluster Monitoring Solution using Bash to collect the hardware specifications of each node and monitor node resource usages. The data will be collected and stored on a PostgreSQL server that runs inside a docker container.

**Core Java Apps** [[GitHub](https://github.com/jarviscanada/jarvis_data_eng_HassanAkbar/tree/masterhttps://github.com/jarviscanada/jarvis_data_eng_HassanAkbar/tree/master/core_java)]:
      
  - JDBC App: JDBC (Java Database Connectivity) is the Java API that manages connecting to a database, issuing queries and commands, and handling result sets obtained from the database.
  - Grep App: Application work just like the Linux grep command. The Java Grep Application searches files in the directory, and regex pattern matching with strings within the files. This application includes two different implementations of reading and writing files, one using BuffererReader and FileOutputStream and the other using Lambda and Stream APIs. This application implements Maven as a java tool to streamline the build process. The app was packaged using Maven and saved to Docker Hub as a Docker Image where it can be pulled and run.
